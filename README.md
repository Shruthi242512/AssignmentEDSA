Assignment Question 8: Earthquake Rescue Robot Coordinator  

Scenario: You’re designing an Earthquake Rescue Robot Coordinator to deploy robots (e.g., "Scanner", "Digger", "Lift", "Light", "Drone") for disaster relief. The system uses: 

Mission Request System (Queue): Rescue tasks queue up from survivors. 

Urgent Task Handler (Stack): Critical tasks stack in LIFO order for immediate action. 

Rescue Log Unit (Array): Completed missions log into an array-based base (size: 6 slots). If full, the oldest is reported. 

Repair Tracker (Linked Lists): 

Damaged robots go to a singly linked list. 

Repaired robots move to a doubly linked list for inspection. 

High-priority robots cycle in a circular linked list for urgent redeployment. 

Objective: Simulate rescue mission coordination, logging, and robot repair. 

Tasks:[Text Wrapping Break] 

a) Mission and Urgency  

Simulate 6 tasks (e.g., "Scanner", "Digger", "Lift", "Light", "Drone", "Cutter") arriving in a queue. 

Stack urgent tasks in LIFO order. Write pseudocode or an algorithm to: 

Enqueue all 6 tasks. 

Dequeue and push onto a stack. 

Pop to show action order. 

Creativity Bonus: Describe (in 2-3 sentences) why LIFO fits (e.g., "Cutter" last to clear debris safely). 

b) Rescue Log Unit  

Log missions in a 6-slot array. 

Simulate logging 8 missions (e.g., "Mis1", "Mis2", ..., "Mis8"). If full, report the oldest. Write pseudocode or an algorithm to: 

Insert the first 6 missions. 

Handle overflow for "Mis7" and "Mis8". 

Creativity Bonus: Suggest (in 2-3 sentences) a reason for reporting (e.g., survivor status updates). 

c) Damaged Robot Tracker  

"Digger" and "Drone" are damaged. Add to a singly linked list. 

Move "Digger" to a doubly linked list post-repair. Write pseudocode or an algorithm to: 

Insert "Digger" and "Drone". 

Delete "Digger" and insert it into the doubly linked list. 

Traverse forward and backward. 

Creativity Bonus: Propose (in 2-3 sentences) a damage and fix (e.g., "Digger’s arm crushed, rebuilt by techs"). 

d) Priority Redeployment  

"Scanner" and "Lift" need urgent redeployment (e.g., trapped survivors). Add to a circular linked list. Write pseudocode or an algorithm to: 

Insert "Scanner" and "Lift". 

Traverse twice. 

Creativity Bonus: Invent (in 2-3 sentences) a redeployment tweak (e.g., "Lift gets a thermal camera").
