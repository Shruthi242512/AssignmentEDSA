# Earthquake Rescue Robot Coordinator â€“ CS Assignment

**Course:** Elementary Data Structures and Algorithms  
**Assignment Question 8**

## Overview

This project simulates a disaster relief coordination system using core data structures like **queues, stacks, arrays, singly/doubly/circular linked lists**. Robots are assigned to missions, tracked for damage and repair, and redeployed based on urgency.

## Structure

### a) Mission and Urgency â€” Queue + Stack

- **Queue** simulates mission requests from survivors.
- **Stack** manages urgent tasks in **LIFO** order.
- Six tasks: `Scanner`, `Digger`, `Lift`, `Light`, `Drone`, `Cutter`.
- Tasks are enqueued, dequeued, and pushed to the stack.
- Stack is popped to determine the order of execution.

#### Creativity Bonus ðŸ’¡
LIFO works best in urgency. If "Cutter" is stacked last, it's accessed first to clear debris, giving way to other robots. This priority ensures faster access to trapped survivors.

### b) Rescue Log Unit â€” Fixed Array

- Uses a **fixed-size array** (size 6) for mission logging.
- Inserts 8 missions (`Mis1` to `Mis8`) to simulate overflow.
- When full, the system reports the oldest logged mission.

#### Creativity Bonus ðŸ’¡
Reporting the oldest mission keeps rescue teams informed of survivor status. It ensures no mission goes unreported due to memory constraints.

---

### c) Damaged Robot Tracker â€” Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List** for damaged robots: `Digger`, `Drone`.
- `Digger` is repaired and moved to a **Doubly Linked List** for inspection.
- Forward and backward traversal ensures maintenance quality.

#### Creativity Bonus ðŸ’¡
`Digger` suffered a crushed arm due to a collapsed tunnel. Techs replaced the joint hydraulics and tested movement in reverse to validate symmetry.

---

### d) Priority Redeployment â€” Circular Linked List

- **Circular Linked List** manages `Scanner` and `Lift` for fast redeployment.
- Traversed twice to simulate continuous operation in loops.

#### Creativity Bonus ðŸ’¡
`Lift` is upgraded with a thermal camera to detect survivor body heat in rubble. `Scanner` syncs with it to plan pathfinding in zero visibility.
